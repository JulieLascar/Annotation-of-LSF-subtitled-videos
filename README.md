# Annotation of LSF subtitled videos
 
The aim of our current projects is to contribute in developing resources and automatic analysis of LSF videos.  
We propose an method that takes advantage of the skills of linguists associated with machine learning methods :  

Step 1 : weakly supervised segmentation of specific signs in the videos, without use of any isolated example.  
Step 2 : expert reviewing of the segmented signs  
Step 3 : supervised classification
