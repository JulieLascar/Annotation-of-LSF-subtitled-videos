# Annotation of LSF subtitled videos
 
The aim of our current projects is to contribute in developing resources and automatic analysis of LSF videos.  
We propose a method that takes advantage of the skills of linguists associated with machine learning methods :  

Step 1 : weakly supervised segmentation of specific signs in the videos, without use of any isolated example.  
Step 2 : expert reviewing of the segmented signs  
Step 3 : supervised classification
